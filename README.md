# microCMS

## WHAT
A Micro Content Management System that is small, easy to use, install, maintain and update, pluggable, themeable, api enabled and downright <strong>Simple</strong>.

## NOTICE
This project is currently in Beta Status (Testing). Contributors and Issues are welcome.

### WHY
Because the Micro-CMS is old and outdated, it's in need of a revamp, project is about 70% complete.
Wordpress is too big, too bulky and downright unsecure in many ways, the microCMS is not a revamped version of WordPress, it is rather a small version that can act like wordpress without all of the uneeded BS.

### WHEN
Ongoing and Evolving

### INTENT
Small footprint, easy to install, fast load, class based, pluggable and themeable.

### INSTALLING
1. Upload the entire contents to you web root
2. Configure your database to use with the microCMS

5. Follow the instructions to install your site
6. It is recommended to delete mc-install.php when you are finished installing
7. Navigate to /mc-admin

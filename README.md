# microCMS

## WHAT
A Micro Content Management System that is small, easy to use, install, maintain and update, pluggable, themeable, api enabled and downright <strong>Simple</strong>.

## NOTICE
This is in Development and <strong>NOT</strong> production ready. Contributors are welcome.

### WHY
Because the Micro-CMS is old and outdated, it's in need of a revamp, project is about 70% complete.
Wordpress is too big, too bulky and downright unsecure in many ways, the microCMS is not a revamped version of WordPress, it is rather a small version that can act like wordpress without all of the uneeded BS.

### WHEN
Ongoing and Evolving

### INTENT
Small footprint, easy to install, fast load, class based, pluggable and themeable.
